# Day 1: No Time for a Taxicab

Day 1 and we're already moving on a grid! I used a dataclass for coordinates - I've got a feeling I'll use it a lot.

Got some good results with Github Copilot. Clearly someone's solution for this exact task was in the training data, because I got a working solution for part 1 almost automatically. But the solution for part 2 needed some fixes.

# Day 2: Bathroom Security

Another Copilot experiment. Got the code almost right for part 1 and very wrong for part 2. I rewrote it using too many elifs, the code could be made shorter by using hexadecimal numbers.

# Day 3: Squares With Three Sides

Again correct results from Copilot for part 1 only. For part 2, I ended up disabling it because it tried to write it in a completely different way. Shorter, arguably more elegant, but wrong. The code is still simple, but already too much for the AI.
