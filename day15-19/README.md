## Day 15: Timing is Everything

We got a machine with spinning disks and need to calculate when they reach
a specific position. Solved the puzzle in two ways: brute force - iterating
through the steps, and fancy, using Chinese Remainder Theorem. Actually the
brute force version was good enough, it only took about 2 seconds.
Python is notorious for low performance, yet it iterated through 3 million
steps in a moment. Computers are really fast!

## Day 16: Dragon Checksum

Generating checksums. Nothing fancy here.
