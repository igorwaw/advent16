# Advent of Code 2016

Advent of Code is a serious of programming puzzles: https://adventofcode.com/2022/about
Here is my take on the 2016 edition, done well later.

Feel free to use for inspiration. For some tasks I implemented more than was
required because I felt like it, for others I went straight to the point.

## Technology used

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-%3E%3D3.7-blue) 

Task 1 requires Python 3.7 or higher because I used dataclass.
All other programs should work with older versions of Python3 as well.

Extra Python libraries: none now


## AI powered

For this edition I experimented using Github Copilot to assist. From my experience, it worked great for the standard stuff such as opening files, iterating etc. - eg. I wrote "with" and automatically got "open INPUTFILE as f:". Then, when writing the main algorithm, I often disabled it because I kept getting wrong but distracting suggestions.
